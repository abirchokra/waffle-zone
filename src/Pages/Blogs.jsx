                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Making waffles that are both satisfying and beneficial for your health is all about the ingredients. By focusing on certain nutrients, we can create a version of waffles that supports overall wellness without compromising on taste. Let’s look at some of the key components to make your waffles a little bit healthier.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-500">Whole Grains and Fiber-Rich Flour</h3>
                            <p class="text-lg">One of the best ways to boost the nutritional value of your waffles is by switching out regular white flour for whole grain or fiber-rich flour. Whole wheat, oat, or almond flour are excellent alternatives that provide more fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Fiber helps regulate digestion, supports heart health, and keeps you feeling fuller for longer.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-500">Healthy Fats: Adding Flaxseeds or Avocados</h3>
                            <p class="text-lg">Adding healthy fats into your waffle batter can increase the nutritional profile of your meal. Flaxseeds, chia seeds, or even avocados provide omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial for your heart and brain health. Avocados can also make waffles fluffier and provide a subtle richness without adding harmful trans fats.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-500">Plant-Based Milks and Natural Sweeteners</h3>
                            <p class="text-lg">For a dairy-free option, consider using plant-based milks like almond, oat, or coconut milk. These options are not only lactose-free but also contain added vitamins like vitamin D and calcium, promoting bone health. When it comes to sweetening your waffles, try natural sweeteners like honey, maple syrup, or stevia instead of refined sugar. These alternatives have a lower glycemic index, offering a healthier way to satisfy your sweet tooth.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-500">Protein-Rich Toppings</h3>
                            <p class="text-lg">Waffles can be more than just a carb-heavy breakfast. By topping them with protein-rich ingredients like Greek yogurt, nut butters, or a handful of nuts and seeds, you can turn your waffles into a balanced meal. Protein is essential for muscle repair, immune function, and overall health. This addition ensures your waffle breakfast keeps you energized throughout the day.</p>
